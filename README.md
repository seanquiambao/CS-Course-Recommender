## Project Description
### Importance of the Project
 > This project is important to us since we wanted a more efficient and easier way to plan out our courses. We wanted to create a program that recommends engineering courses to take for each quarter depending on how difficult the class is (based from the UCR difficulty database spreadsheet). This program can allow us to even out our workload throughout the school year and help us take less strenuous classes.
### Planned Technologies
 > We plan to use the following technologies in this class:
 > * **Vim** - A text editor used to create files and edit code for our project
 > * **Visual** Studio Code - A source-code editor used to create files and write code for our program and is also used as a visual debugging tool.
 > * **Git** - A local-based version control system used to keep track of changes made by the contributors of the repository. We will use GitHub as our cloud-based to push any changes into our repository.
 > * **C++** - A programming language used to code our project.
 > * **GDB (GNU Debugger)** - A dynamic debugger tool used to identify issues within our program. This is used to detect bugs in our C++ code.
 > * **Valgrind** - An instrumentation framework used to check for memory management and threading bugs. This is used to detect memory leaks and dangling pointers within our program.
 > * **LibXL** - A C++ Excel Library for reading/writing data from an excel file (Google Sheets UCR Difficulty Database will be exported into an excel file). This will be used to read input given by the user, which will be discussed in a later segment.
### Input/Output
 > **Input** - The user can input the courses they have already taken, this can be inputted through either a .txt file or an Excel file. This input will be used to calculate the amount of credits taken, which can be used to calculate the amount of credits required. This will also be used as a prerequisite checklist for specific computer science courses. The user can also input classes into their planner, if they meet the required prerequisite.<br>
 > **Output** - The program will output a list of engineering courses, ordered from the least to most difficult. It will only output the courses that the user needs, and will only show the courses that meet the userâ€™s prerequisites requirements. The program will also output the planner the user has created, which will output the average difficulty and the amount of units for that planned quarter.
### Features
 > * The user can create a planner for each quarter. The user is allowed to add or remove courses from the planner. When adding courses, the program will sum up all the units. The program will also show the average difficulty so that the user can see the amount of workload they have. This average difficulty is calculated based on the UCR difficulty database. This program can also calculate the expected graduation date.
 > * The user can search up the courses. The search bar will be divided whether the course is a lower division course, upper division course, or elective course. The program will also show some breadth courses for each area of study (we will focus on the three most popular breadth courses for each area of study). The user can select a course in the view finder, which will display the courses prerequisite, amount of units, and difficulty.

## Class Diagrams
### First UML Diagram
![UML Diagram of SQL class and Course Recommender Class](images/classDiagram.jpg)
 > This first class diagram includes the structure of the program. The SQL class will use a sqlite3 header file to call certain SQL functions such as reading off UCR difficulty database, or creating tables for each classes. 
 > * The SQL class will have a int rc variable that will determine whether the database can be opened or not. SQL class will hold an SQL object (db *sqlite3) that will provide commands for the SQL language.
 
 > * The SQL() function will first open up the database file and check whether the file has sucessfully opened. It will then read off the file and execute SQL commands to construct tables for each UCR classes. ~SQL() destructor will deallocate any memory used up in the program. callBack() function essentially acts as a helper function that retrieves data from the database. insert_into() functions adds UCR classes in to the SQL tables.
 > * In the Course Recommender class it will hold a list of strings that will hold the breadth requirements the students need to satisfy. Add requirements prompts the user to add requirements they need ot complete. The printEasiest functions will print a list of 3 easiest classes for each breadth requirements. 
 ### Second UML Diagram
![UML Diagram with additional planer Class](images/classDiagramPlan.jpg)
 > The second class diagram has the same structure as the first UML class diagram, however there is an additional class for the planner section. 
 > * The planner will essentially take a list of strings of each classes the user has added. The getAverage will return the average of the difficulty of all of the user classes. Determine difficulty will return a string that states whether the planned quarter is either easy, decent, or hard (based on the average difficulty). The planner will also call the printPlanner() function to print the list of classes and their associated difficulty.

 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase I.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
> 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
